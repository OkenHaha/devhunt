# Story
I found out about Dennis Ivy Hackathon a few days late. And as I immediately tried to join and participate it, I lost some days in finiding a designer but luckily I manage to find one from discord. His username is **Ilyasse Njh#1362**. Both of us ran into problems and issues while working on the project. We weren't able to finish the project completely but hopefully we'll work on it after the hackathon itself and make it a good one. My teammate also learned few things and new ones also, like praticing more on his design skills. I also learned a few new things, like FastAPI, React and HarperDB. Hopefully in the next hackathon and many more to come, I'll be at be able to complete a functionning project
